# Project Name: SAGA Movie List
​
The purpose of this application is to allow users to navigate through a list of movies. Each movie directs the user to another route where they obtain information about their title and description, and updating them from a database. This javascript app requires using React, SAGA and routers/routes to design its architecture. In addition, this app uses redux to store and manipulate data from the database.
